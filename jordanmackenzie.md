### Hi there, I'm Jordan Mackenzie 👋

I am currently pursuing my **MSc in Computer Science** at the **University of York (UK)**, transitioning into tech with a strong focus on Backend Engineering and Security.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **[Beatrice](https://github.com/yourusername/beatrice)**, an async TUI chat app implementing hybrid encryption.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Network Security, Encryption, and Advanced Python**.
- 🎯 **Goal:** Pivoting from my previous career to become a full-time Software Engineer.
- 🚴 **Fun fact:** I am a cycling fanatic. I will happily watch every minute of every Grand Tour stage. ps. the Giro is my fav.
- 🐶 **My Co-pilot:** I have a puppy named Beatrice. She has no idea what encryption is, but I named my [chat app](https://github.com/yourusername/beatrice) after her anyway.
- 🔥 **Favourite film:** Back To The Future
